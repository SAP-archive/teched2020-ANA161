## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called ANA161 - The Ultimate Deep Dive into SAP Analytics Cloud

## Overview

This session consists of a series of exercises to introduce you to the most innovative features in SAP Analytics Cloud. You will learn how to upload data and start your first story, use the newest data visualization features, harness smart analytics to get the most from your data, and build impactful stories.

For the more experienced SAP Analytics Cloud users, we have also included additional in-depth content in our Jump Off sections. These will teach you our best practices and most powerful features for creating calculations and blending data, building versatile geo visualizations, manipulating time dimensions, and showcasing your work in Digital Boardroom.

## Requirements

We will be using a provided SAP Analytics Cloud tenant for these exercises.

Users:

Our exercises build on the previous exercise for a holistic learning experience. For newer users, it is recommended to follow the exercises in order. You may find each completed exercise as a story that can be duplicated from the Public/TechEd folder on the tenant. This allows you to personalize your session experience by moving to the section most interesting to you.
